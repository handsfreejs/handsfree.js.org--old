> # About this Repo
>
> This repo represents our site, [handsfree.js.org](https://handsfree.js.org). If you're looking for the library, it's located at [https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree](https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree)

# Local Development

To run this project locally you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable).

After downloading this project repo, you'll then need to install dependencies by running `yarn` in the project's root directory. Then you'll have the following commands available:

```bash
# Start a local dev environment on localhost:8080
yarn start

# Build for production into /dist/demos/
yarn build

# Deploy to handsfree.js.org
yarn deploy

# Create handsfree.js in /dist/handsfreejs/
yarn bundle
```

Assuming you haven't downloaded this repository yet, the following are the steps you should do in order:

1. Download this repository: `git clone https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree.js.org.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd handsfree.js.org && yarn`
3. Run the development server: `yarn start`

If you don't have git, you can also just [download and unzip our latest archive](https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree/archive/master.zip). You'll still need to install dependencies by running `yarn` in the unzipped directory.

## Deploy Script

Running `yarn deploy` will commit everything inside of `/dist/demos` to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository set in `package.json > deploy.repo` using the `package.json > deploy.url` custom domain. This lets you quickly deploy this repository to GitHub Pages!

# Special Thanks

A very special thanks goes out to [@Golan](https://twitter.com/golan) for inviting me out to his studio, [The STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) during the [Spring of 2019](https://www.flickr.com/photos/creativeinquiry/albums/72157703188612302). It was during this residency that I was encouraged to begin integrating Handsfree.js into different libraries and where I had a chance to use Handsfree.js with a real UR5 robot!

Another special thanks goes out to [@AnilDash](https://twitter.com/anildash) for sponsoring me during Winter 2018. Also a thank you to [The School of AI](https://twitter.com/SchoolOfAIOffic) for the [2018 Fellowship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJDpF4xUieY&t=58). And a very special thanks to [Jess Holbrook](https://twitter.com/jessscon) from Google Pair for driving all the way (way) out to meet me and helping kickstart this all with a new computer!

Thanks also to everyone who's supported me on Patreon, GoFundMe, and through Twitter over the months (and almost years!). And thanks everyone else for believing in this project ðŸ‘‹
